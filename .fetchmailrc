#  CONFIGURATION EXAMPLES
#      Basic format is:
#
#        poll SERVERNAME protocol PROTOCOL username NAME password PASSWORD
#
#      Example:
#
#        poll pop.provider.net protocol pop3 username jsmith password secret1
#
#      Or, using some abbreviations:
#
#        poll pop.provider.net proto pop3 user jsmith password secret1
#
#      Multiple servers may be listed:
#
#        poll pop.provider.net proto pop3 user jsmith pass secret1
#        poll other.provider.net proto pop2 user John.Smith pass My^Hat
#
#      Here's a version of those two  with  more  whitespace  and
#      some noise words:
#
#        poll pop.provider.net proto pop3
#            user jsmith, with password secret1, is jsmith here;
#        poll other.provider.net proto pop2:
#            user John.Smith, with password My^Hat, is John.Smith here;
#
#      This  version is much easier to read and doesn't cost sig-
#      nificantly more (parsing is done  only  once,  at  startup
#      time).
#
#
#      If  you  need to include whitespace in a parameter string,
#      enclose the string in double quotes.  Thus:
#
#        poll mail.provider.net with proto pop3:
#              user jsmith there has password "u can't krak this"
#                          is jws here and wants mda "/bin/mail"
#
#      You may have an initial server description headed  by  the
#      keyword  `defaults'  instead of `poll' followed by a name.
#      Such a record is interpreted as defaults for  all  queries
#      to  use.  It  may  be  overwritten  by  individual  server
#      descriptions.  So, you could write:
#
#        defaults proto pop3
#              user jsmith
#        poll pop.provider.net
#              pass secret1
#        poll mail.provider.net
#              user jjsmith there has password secret2
#
#      Here's an example configuration using ssh.  The queries go
#      through an ssh connecting local port 1234 to port  110  on
#      mailhost.net; the preconnect command sets up the ssh.
#
#      poll mailhost.net via localhost port 1234 with pop3:
#              preconnect "ssh -f -L 1234:mailhost.net:110
#                         mailhost.net sleep 20 </dev/null >/dev/null";
#
#
#  Run Control Syntax
#      Comments begin with a '#' and extend through  the  end  of
#      the  line.   Otherwise  the  file  consists of a series of
#      server entries or global option statements in a  free-for-
#      mat, token-oriented syntax.
#
#      There  are four kinds of tokens: grammar keywords, numbers
#      (i.e. decimal  digit  sequences),  unquoted  strings,  and
#      quoted  strings.   A  quoted  string  is bounded by double
#      quotes and may contain whitespace (and quoted  digits  are
#      treated  as  a string).  An unquoted string is any whites-
#      pace-delimited  token  that  is  neither  numeric,  string
#      quoted  nor contains the special characters `,', `;', `:',
#      or `='.
#
#      Any  amount  of  whitespace  separates  tokens  in  server
#      entries, but is otherwise ignored. You may use standard C-
#      style escapes (\n, \t, \b, octal, and hex) to  embed  non-
#      printable characters or string delimiters in strings.
#
#      Each  server  entry consists of one of the keywords `poll'
#      or `skip', followed by a server name, followed  by  server
#      options,  followed  by  any  number  of user descriptions.
#      Note: the most common cause of syntax errors is mixing  up
#      user and server options.
#
#      For backward compatibility, the word `server' is a synonym
#      for `poll'.
#
#      You can use  the  noise  keywords  `and',  `with',  `has',
#      `wants',  and  `options'  anywhere  in an entry to make it
#      resemble English.   They're  ignored,  but  but  can  make
#      entries  much easier to read at a glance.  The punctuation
#      characters ':', ';' and ',' are also ignored.
#
#
#  Poll vs. Skip
#      The `poll' verb tells fetchmail to query this host when it
#      is run with no arguments.  The `skip' verb tells fetchmail
#      not to poll this host unless it is explicitly named on the
#      command  line.   (The `skip' verb allows you to experiment
#      with test entries safely, or easily  disable  entries  for
#      hosts that are temporarily down.)
